CI Deploy User Guide
====================

This introduction will guide user to deploy an (Openstack) CI environment. The workflow of
deploying CI has been introduced in `Openstack Third-part CI <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/openstackci/third_party_ci.html>`_ . Please read it.

Now, according to the `Openstack Third-part CI <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/openstackci/third_party_ci.html>`_ , we draft a script to deploy ci master node automatically. You can find this script in `../code/deploy-cimaster-with-proxy.sh`.
