Get Runnning Sevice State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two methods of getting running service state is given:
* eventlet.backdoor_server
* GMR (Guru Meditation Reports)

eventlet.backdoor_server
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

When building, each service could build a backdoor server according to
the backdoor_port option in config. Backdoor_port allows user connect to
node to debug and get running service state by telnet.

Using the following code to create backdoor_server:
::

  from eventlet import backdoor
  import eventlet
  
  eventlet.spawn(backdoor.backdoor_server, eventlet.listen(('localhost', PORT)), locals=backdoor_locals)
  
`backdoor_locals` is a dirc <key, value>, defining functions which can be called by admin.

Detailed instances is in the link:

In addition, `eventlet.backdoor_server` has several weaknesses:
* Each service, accompanying with backdoor server, need to set a TCP port which is recorded by admin.
* Once service restart, all key info will be lost.
* It's dangerous that Each service leaves a port.

GMR
""""""

User can send a `USER2` signal, then generate a report.
The report is a general-purpose debug report for developers
and system admins which contains the current state of a running Designate service process.

Generate a GMR
----------------

A GMR can be generated by sending the USR2 signal to any Designate processes.

For example, suppose designate-central has pid 15097, kill -USR2 15097 will trigger a GMR.

If option logdir has been set in designate.conf, the GMR will be saved in the folder
which logdir specified. Otherwise, the GMR will be printed to the stderr.
